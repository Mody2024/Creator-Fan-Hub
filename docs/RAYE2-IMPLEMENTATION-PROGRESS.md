## Progress snapshot — 2026-11-04

These are conservative repository-based estimates against the **entire ten-wave platform**, not the old chat/voice-only scope. A feature earns credit only for code that exists in this repository; a route, plan item, schema proposal, or legacy feature elsewhere in the product is not treated as an end-to-end Raye2 implementation.

| Wave | Scope | Implementation estimate | Current evidence / remaining work |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 0 | Repository audit and implementation map | **55%** | Master plan and initial source/migration/test inventory exist. Complete route-by-route and requirement-by-requirement gap matrix, provider/config audit, and unresolved decision closure remain. |
| 1 | Brand system and full product redesign | **0%** | Current Raye2 CSS still uses the legacy lime-accent visual system. Black/white/grey/blue tokens, shared shell, typography, responsive redesign and full-surface review remain. |
| 2 | Core architecture, accounts and permissions | **25%** | Existing authenticated Raye2 workspace, membership models, RLS/guarded RPCs and some admin controls exist. Unified profile/social identity, route guards, consistent cross-surface authorization and full negative permission tests remain. |
| 3 | Video, feed and discovery | **5%** | The repository contains older/adjacent video and community code, but no verified integrated Raye2 home/feed, discovery and complete native-media journey. Do not count legacy surfaces as finished Raye2 features. |
| 4 | Creator Studio, exclusives and live streaming | **5%** | Existing creator tools are present elsewhere in the app, but Raye2-specific role/quota workflow, media lifecycle, exclusives and real live ingest/delivery are not complete. |
| 5 | Social graph, communities and engagement | **15%** | Raye2 public/private groups, membership and moderation foundations exist. Full profiles/follows, community publishing, polls/events/collections and connected engagement surfaces remain. |
| 6 | Messaging and chat | **85%** | Strong implementation: DMs/groups, message actions, requests, search, pins, notifications, quiet hours, moderation, invites, Shared Memories and group controls. Remaining: runtime DB/RLS acceptance, delivery/push, attachment/media lifecycle, and end-to-end operational verification. |
| 7 | Voice and Watch Together | **55%** | Private WebRTC call path, LiveKit group-room integration path/moderation, voice preferences, Watch Together sessions/queue/playback sync exist. Real provider deployment, multi-device/network acceptance, reconnection/telemetry, consented recording pipeline, external embeds/invites and remaining session features are outstanding. |
| 8 | Admin Rules Engine and governance | **35%** | Existing owner/admin-gated controls, retention/cleanup request foundations and audit concepts exist. A unified configurable Rules Engine, operational dashboards, full moderation workflow, quota/feature controls and verified destructive-action recovery remain. |
| 9 | Security, reliability and release readiness | **15%** | Contract tests and security-oriented migrations exist. Runtime RLS/RPC tests, applied migration verification, cleanup worker/object deletion, load/capacity/cost checks, full accessibility/device acceptance and owner approval remain. |

**Estimated full-platform implementation: ~30%.** This is a planning estimate, not a measured metric. The earlier ~65% referred to the narrower chat/voice plan and must not be reused as whole-platform completion.

### Verification and release gates
- **Automated verification:** meaningful contract-test coverage exists for chat, voice, Watch Together and admin contracts, but the latest confirmed successful GitHub Actions run is for commit `1dec9e0d`, not the reviewed HEAD. The last successful Validate site and Free CI runs are on commit `7a28ad46`, before the latest theme-switcher commits. The latest HEAD's Vercel development deployment is pending at the time of this snapshot; no latest-HEAD test pass is claimed.
- **Database/runtime verification:** Raye2 migrations are committed in the repository; this snapshot does not prove they have been applied to the intended Supabase project or passed live RLS/RPC tests.
- **Preview/owner acceptance:** not yet recorded for the complete platform or redesigned primary surfaces.
- **Production:** no merge/deployment authorized.

## Latest design batch (commit `a1da7035`)
- [x] Establish Raye2-only blue/graphite design tokens and layered panel/surface styling.
- [x] Add explicit accessible focus states and reduced-motion-compatible existing motion behavior.
- [x] Add light-theme CSS variables and light surface overrides.
- [x] Add a persistent user-controlled light/dark switcher, with graceful fallback if browser storage is unavailable.
- [ ] Extend the new design system to the full product shell, brand/logo, typography, global navigation, creator surfaces, feed and video UI.

## Next large implementation batches

1. **Wave 0 completion + Wave 1 redesign foundation:** finish the implementation map, then replace the legacy lime theme with the Raye2 black/white/grey/blue design tokens, typography, shared navigation and responsive shell.
2. **Core product surfaces:** build the connected Raye2 home/feed, Explore/search, profiles and community surfaces on shared data contracts.
3. **Media + Creator Studio:** integrate native video lifecycle, Mini's/Moments, creator/streamer role quotas and publishing workflows.
4. **Community + engagement:** connect follows, communities, posts, polls, events, collections and custom reactions.
5. **Finish communications:** close remaining chat/voice/Watch Together gaps and operational provider setup.
6. **Admin + hardening:** complete Rules Engine, cleanup worker, security/runtime tests, capacity checks and acceptance matrix.

Keep updating this file after each meaningful batch. Report implementation, automated verification, preview verification and owner acceptance separately. Do not mark a wave complete based on a plan, placeholder, route render or successful deployment alone.
