## Progress snapshot — 2026-11-05

These are conservative repository-based estimates against the **entire ten-wave platform**, not the old chat/voice-only scope. A feature earns credit only for code that exists in this repository; a route, plan item, schema proposal, or legacy feature elsewhere in the product is not treated as an end-to-end Raye2 implementation.

| Wave | Scope | Implementation estimate | Current evidence / remaining work |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 0 | Repository audit and implementation map | **55%** | Master plan and initial source/migration/test inventory exist. Complete route-by-route and requirement-by-requirement gap matrix, provider/config audit, and unresolved decision closure remain. |
| 1 | Brand system and full product redesign | **31%** | Raye2 messaging has blue/graphite tokens, dark/light controls and bilingual responsive navigation; the new home and Explore surfaces have matching scoped blue/graphite layouts, responsive behavior and Arabic/English content. Full shared shell, final logo/brand integration, typography and redesign of all other surfaces remain. |
| 2 | Core architecture, accounts and permissions | **27%** | Existing authenticated Raye2 workspace, membership models, RLS/guarded RPCs and some admin controls exist. Unified profile/social identity, route guards, consistent cross-surface authorization and full negative permission tests remain. |
| 3 | Video, feed and discovery | **22%** | New Raye2 home queries latest/following community posts and published video catalog entries; post cards support native reactions, comments, bookmarks, follow/unfollow and share with batch-loaded state; published video thumbnail assets are surfaced where configured; `/search` has been redesigned as a bilingual Raye2 Explore experience across videos, people and community posts. Full player previews, search ranking, richer recommendations and complete media journey remain. |
| 4 | Creator Studio, exclusives and live streaming | **7%** | Existing creator tools are present elsewhere in the app, but Raye2-specific role/quota workflow, media lifecycle, exclusives and real live ingest/delivery are not complete. |
| 5 | Social graph, communities and engagement | **16%** | Raye2 public/private groups, membership and moderation foundations exist. Full profiles/follows, community publishing, polls/events/collections and connected engagement surfaces remain. |
| 6 | Messaging and chat | **85%** | Strong implementation: DMs/groups, message actions, requests, search, pins, notifications, quiet hours, moderation, invites, Shared Memories and group controls. Remaining: runtime DB/RLS acceptance, delivery/push, attachment/media lifecycle, and end-to-end operational verification. |
| 7 | Voice and Watch Together | **55%** | Private WebRTC call path, LiveKit group-room integration path/moderation, voice preferences, Watch Together sessions/queue/playback sync exist. Real provider deployment, multi-device/network acceptance, reconnection/telemetry, consented recording pipeline, external embeds/invites and remaining session features are outstanding. |
| 8 | Admin Rules Engine and governance | **35%** | Existing owner/admin-gated controls, retention/cleanup request foundations and audit concepts exist. A unified configurable Rules Engine, operational dashboards, full moderation workflow, quota/feature controls and verified destructive-action recovery remain. |
| 9 | Security, reliability and release readiness | **16%** | Contract tests and security-oriented migrations exist. Runtime RLS/RPC tests, applied migration verification, cleanup worker/object deletion, load/capacity/cost checks, full accessibility/device acceptance and owner approval remain. |

**Estimated full-platform implementation: ~37%.** This is a planning estimate, not a measured metric. The earlier ~65% referred to the narrower chat/voice plan and must not be reused as whole-platform completion.

### Verification and release gates
- **Automated verification:** `Validate site` passed on code HEAD `f42de989` (including 207 prototype/configuration tests, Next.js type-check + production build, and lint). The video-thumbnail and Explore batch on `5554261f` passed the full `Validate site` workflow, including 207 prototype/configuration tests, Next.js type-check + production build, and lint. The subsequent member-profile redesign is committed on `76752f79`; its full validation is still running, and the latest `e29cce1` Creator Studio batch passed `Validate site` and `Free CI`. The separate `Free CI` run passed on `e29cce1`.
- **Database/runtime verification:** Raye2 migrations are committed in the repository; this snapshot does not prove they have been applied to the intended Supabase project or passed live RLS/RPC tests.
- **Preview/owner acceptance:** Vercel development deployment completed successfully for `f42de989`. The `5554261f` and `9f8e7167` development preview deployments were pending at last check; the latest `e29cce1` development preview was building at the last check; do not treat it as ready until Vercel reports `READY`. Browser/device smoke tests and owner acceptance of the complete platform/redesigned primary surfaces remain outstanding. Browser/device smoke tests and owner acceptance of the complete platform/redesigned primary surfaces are still outstanding.
- **Production:** no merge/deployment authorized.

- [x] Add responsive blue/graphite styling and Arabic RTL support.
- [x] Add a separate Beta / Coming Soon backlog so proposed ideas do not become fake controls or silently block private beta.
- [ ] Replace the legacy creator tool surfaces with the shared Raye2 shell; this entry point currently links to existing functional tools.

- [ ] Complete the end-to-end upload/draft/publish workflow and provider-backed live streaming; this batch does not claim those workflows are complete.

## Next large implementation batches

1. **Wave 1 redesign:** extend the new design system and navigation across Watch, Mini's, Creator Studio and all remaining public platform surfaces.
2. **Core product surfaces:** build the connected Raye2 home/feed, Explore/search, profiles and community surfaces on shared data contracts.
3. **Media + Creator Studio:** integrate native video lifecycle, Mini's/Moments, creator/streamer role quotas and publishing workflows.
4. **Community + engagement:** connect follows, communities, posts, polls, events, collections and custom reactions.
5. **Finish communications:** close remaining chat/voice/Watch Together gaps and operational provider setup.
6. **Admin + hardening:** complete Rules Engine, cleanup worker, security/runtime tests, capacity checks and acceptance matrix.

Keep updating this file after each meaningful batch. Report implementation, automated verification, preview verification and owner acceptance separately. Do not mark a wave complete based on a plan, placeholder, route render or successful deployment alone.

- [x] Correct the Creator Studio role gate so assigned `creator` accounts can open the workspace and access publishing tools.
- [x] Add contract tests for role access, navigation and shared visual tokens.
